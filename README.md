# Arduino IDE

1. Open the Serial Port and select the board and port

   - Arduino Uno
   - Whichever port isn't bluetooth probably

2. To upload new code:

   - Unplug Rx from Arduino (turn off headset if its on, you're wasting the battery)
   - Upload button is in the top left, its an arrow
     - Then verify, the check button to the left of upload

3. To run program:
   - Open Serial Monitor(tools > Serial Monitor)
   - Check baud rate, make sure it matched currently uploaded code
   - Follow the instructions - now you can plug the Rx back into the Arduino and turn on the headset
   - Now we wait - expect a delay
