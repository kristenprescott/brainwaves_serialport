# Arduino IDE

1. Plug in headset

2. Select board and port:

   - Tools > Board: "Arduino Uno"
   - Tools > Port: "/dev/cu.usbserial-1440" (or whichever port isn't bluetooth, port number varies)

3. Open the Serial Monitor, Tools > Serial Monitor (looks like a terminal, lives in the bottom of the IDE)

   - Should see a message if connected, `connect rx and turn headset on`

4. To upload new code:

   - Unplug Rx from Arduino (turn off headset if its on, you're wasting the battery)
   - Upload button is in the top left, its an arrow
     - Then verify, the check button to the left of upload

5. To run program:

   - Open Serial Monitor (Tools > Serial Monitor), if not already open
   - Check/select baud rate (upper right corner of Serial Monitor), make sure it matches whatever is being used in the current code (`Serial.begin(57600)` or `Serial.begin(9600)`, probably)
   - Follow the instructions printed in the Serial Monitor - now you can plug the Rx back into the Arduino and turn on the headset
   - Now we wait - expect a delay, have patience

Example output:

```sh
connect rx and turn headset on

Donning the headset: tips and tricks

- Wash your face, pull back your hair, and clean the headset contacts and the skin they will touch with rubbing alcohol; electroglide gel may help too, but remember - this _is_ a toy...

- Expect 15-30s (iirc) of random data output (TODO: check if I handled that actually...)
